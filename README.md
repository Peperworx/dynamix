# Dynamix

Dynamix is an internal code name for a yet to be named video game. This game is an online, MMO, psuedo battle royale.\

It is currently in early Pre-Alpha, and if all goes according to plan, will be in Alpha stage next month, with open Beta at the end of the Summer. However, we are very likely to hit major roadblocks, as we are very early in development. (Latest Multiplayer test was Pre-Alpha 0.3.6)

## Story:
  Sometime in the future, climate change has caused high strength, persistant, hurricanes. \
  After some time, most governments have collapsed, and the last of humanity are surviving underground, going outsite every time an eye of the storm passes overhead, to collect food and resources.
  You are one of these people.
